# Buy me a coffee or back me on Patreon?
I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider buying me a coffee or backing me on Patreon to say thanks!
